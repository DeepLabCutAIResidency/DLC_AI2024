For a better understanding of the predicted clusters in the [Data Analysis Notebook](data_analysis.ipynb), you can use this Dash app that allows to interactively visualise the raw images corresponding to all the points in the clusters.

To run the Dash app, start by replacing the data files paths in the [cluster_viz_dash.py](cluster_viz_dash.py) file, then, run:
```bash
python cluster_viz_dash.py
```
